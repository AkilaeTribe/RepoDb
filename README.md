## RepoDb

A dynamic, lightweight and fast repo-based ORM .NET Library.

### Package

### Documentation

### Goal

We aim to limit the implementation of SQL Statements in the .NET application.

### Vision

To provide more flexibility and fast-switching development approach, whether to use the massive or lightweight ORM operations.

### Principles

 - We will keep it simple as possible (KISS principle)
 - We will help developers to be more focus on SOLID principle
 - We will make it fast as possible
 - We will make it more flexible
 - We will never ever do try-catch inside the library
 - We will never make complex implementations (specially for complex Join Queries)
