Mapping a Class
----------------

.. highlight:: c#

By default, the name of the class is used as a default mapped object from the database. However, if the database object name is different from the class name, the `MapAttribute` is then use to map it properly.

Below is a sample code that maps the class named `EmployeeDto` into `Employee` table from the database.

::

	[Map("[dbo].[Employee]", CommandType.Text)]
	public class EmployeeDto : DataEntity
	{
		public int Id { get; set; }
	}
