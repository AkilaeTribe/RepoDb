Introduction to RepoDb
======================

A highly-extensible, dynamic, lightweight and fast ORM .Net Library.

Goal
----

We aim to let .NET developers `limit` the implementation of SQL Statements within the application.

We believe that as a .NET developer, one should only focus on .NET and Business scenario development and not on writing repetitive SQL Statements.

Of course, unless you are working closely with SQL Server Management Studio.

Vision
------

To help developers to have more flexibility and easy to fast-switch from ORM massive to lightweight operations.

Principles
----------

* We will keep it simple as possible (KISS principle)
* We will help developers to be more focus on SOLID principle
* We will make it fast as possible
* We will make it more flexible
* We will never ever do try-catch inside the library
* We will never make complex implementations (specially for complex Join Queries)
