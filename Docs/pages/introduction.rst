Introduction to RepoDb
======================

A dynamic, lightweight and fast ORM .Net Library.

Goal and Vision
---------------

We aim to let .NET developers limit the implementation of SQL Statements within the application.

We believe that as a .NET developer, one should only focus on .NET and Business scenario development and not on writing repetitive SQL Statements.

Of course, unless you are working closely with SQL Server Management Studio.

Principles
----------

* We will keep it simple as possible (KISS principle)
* We will make it fast as possible
* We will never make complex implementations (specially for Queries and Methods)
* We will avoid developing complex JOINs (until it is needed and requested by the community)
* We will never ever do try-catch inside the library
* We will help developers to be more focus on SOLID principle
