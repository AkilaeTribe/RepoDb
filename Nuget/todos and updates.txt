[UPDATES]
- EntityNotBulkInsertableException supported when calling BulkInsert with non SqlConnection connection object
- BulkInsert optimization - ordering the columns based on the DB Table ordering (not on DataEntity properties ordering)
- Initial implementation for complex query (QueryGroup)
	- Added QueryGroup (IQueryGroup)
	- Added Conjuctions for QueryGroup(s)
	- Added OrQueryGroup
	- Added AndQueryGroup
- Supported IFieldValue interface for QueryField - to support the QueryGroup parameterized approach
- Renamed QueryField.Value to QueryField.Parameter (with Name and Value properties) and change its Type from object to IParameter
- In QueryFields, if the Operation is '=' and the parameter Value is equals to NULL then we compose ([Field] IS NULL) string statement
	- Solves the problem of: WHERE (SomeDate IS NULL)
	- We also did the same thing for != (SomeDate IS NOT NULL)
- Used the '<>' instead of '!=' in InEquality comparer
- Supported EventNotifier (Tracing and Debugging purposes).
	- You can listen on the following events to see the Statement and Object passed before DB executions
		- BeforeQueryExecution
		- AfterQueryExecution
		- BeforeUpdateExecution
		- AfterUpdateExecution
		- BeforeDeleteExecution
